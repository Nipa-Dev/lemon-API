CI/CD pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software.
Continuous integration ensures that code changes are validated frequently,
while continuous delivery and deployment automate release workflows.

Pipeline stages commonly include linting, unit testing, integration testing,
security scanning, and deployment to staging or production environments.

Effective CI/CD practices reduce deployment risk, improve developer velocity,
and increase system reliability.
