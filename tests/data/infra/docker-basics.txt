Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications and their
dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. Containers run consistently
across development, testing, and production environments.

Docker images are built using Dockerfiles that define the runtime environment,
dependencies, and startup commands. Containers are launched from these images
and isolated from the host system.

Containerization simplifies deployment pipelines, scaling strategies,
and environment reproducibility.
