Infrastructure as code (IaC) treats infrastructure configuration as version-controlled
source code. This enables reproducible environments, peer review of changes,
and automated provisioning.

Popular IaC tools include Terraform, Pulumi, AWS CloudFormation, and Ansible.
These tools define infrastructure resources declaratively or programmatically.

IaC improves consistency across environments and reduces manual configuration errors.
