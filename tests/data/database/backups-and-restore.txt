Regular backups are essential for disaster recovery and data protection.
PostgreSQL supports logical backups using pg_dump and physical backups using
base backups and WAL archiving.

Backup strategies should balance recovery point objectives (RPO),
recovery time objectives (RTO), and storage costs.

Testing restore procedures regularly ensures that backups are valid
and that recovery processes work as expected during incidents.
