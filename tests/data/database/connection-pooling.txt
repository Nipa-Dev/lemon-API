Connection pooling reduces the overhead of creating and destroying database
connections by reusing existing connections across requests.

In high-concurrency applications, pooling is essential to prevent exhausting
database connection limits and degrading performance.

Popular PostgreSQL connection poolers include PgBouncer, Pgpool-II,
and application-level pooling libraries.
