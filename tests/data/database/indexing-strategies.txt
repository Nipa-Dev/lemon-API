Database indexes improve query performance by allowing the database engine to
locate rows without scanning entire tables. Common index types include B-tree,
hash, GIN, and GiST indexes.

GIN indexes are particularly useful for full-text search and JSONB queries,
while GiST indexes support geometric data and range queries.

Effective indexing requires understanding query patterns, write workloads,
and the trade-offs between storage overhead and query speed.
