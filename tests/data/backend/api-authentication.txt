API authentication ensures that only authorized clients can access protected resources.
Common authentication methods include API keys, OAuth2, JWT tokens, and session cookies.

FastAPI provides first-class support for OAuth2 password flow, bearer tokens,
and security dependencies. Authentication is often combined with authorization
logic to determine what actions a user is permitted to perform.

In distributed systems, authentication tokens must be securely stored,
validated efficiently, and rotated periodically to reduce the risk of compromise.
