Background tasks allow applications to perform work after returning a response
to the client. This avoids blocking the request-response cycle while still
triggering side effects such as sending emails or updating caches.

FastAPI supports background tasks through its built-in BackgroundTasks class.
Tasks are executed in the same process after the response is sent.

For heavier workloads or distributed processing, external task queues such as
Celery, RQ, or cloud-native job systems are often more appropriate.
