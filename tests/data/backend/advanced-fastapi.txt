Advanced FastAPI usage includes dependency injection, background tasks,
custom middleware, and advanced response handling. Dependencies allow
developers to share common logic such as authentication, database sessions,
and permission checks across endpoints.

Background tasks can be scheduled to run after returning a response.
This is useful for sending emails, writing audit logs, or triggering workflows.
Middleware provides hooks into the request and response lifecycle, enabling
logging, tracing, metrics collection, and request modification.

FastAPI integrates seamlessly with async database drivers, message queues,
and caching layers, making it a strong choice for production-ready APIs.
